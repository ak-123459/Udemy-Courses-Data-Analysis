- ### **Methodology**
  In the field of data analytics/data science a analyst need to  follow some steps like probelm statements,data extraction,data transfromations and data loading we called the process ETL(Extract transform load) and also Descriptive analytics.so in this project we have followed these setps in power bi.I have provided a file of Udemy_da_powerbi.pdf that contain all streps in pictures to picture that we have used in this analysis project.in the down below the basic method we have followed in each step-
  
  #### 1. Problem Definition
  The goal is understanding the key factor or key points that encourge the users to take the Udemy subscriptions.below down are the list of some task that need to focus and show on report.
  
  ##### Task List
    - Descriptive Analytics (Using Card Visuals)
      
      1.Max Lectures
      
      2.Median Reviews
      
      3.Median Course Durations
  
    - Visualizations (Using Charts)
      
      1.Level-wise Subscribers (in %)
      
      2.Level-wise Average Content Duration
      
      3.Median Number of Subscribers Level-wise
      
      4.Price vs. Number of Subscribers Correlation
      
      5.Subscribers vs. Reviews Correlation
      
      6.Year-Month Wise Total Number of Subscribers
      
      7.Year-wise Reviews in Paid vs. Unpaid Courses
      

&nbsp; &nbsp;     
#### 2. Data Collection
  **Tools** -  *Poer-Bi Data Source*
  We have downloaded the dataset from the open source machine learning aand data scienece websites [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arzubesiroglu/udemy-courses-dataset) and also imported in power bi using excel workbook.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
  #### 3. Data Preprocessing
  **Tools** - *Power-BI Query Editor*
   - Removing nan values,empty,duplcates
   - drop unuseful columns like url etc.
   - add two new columns month,year by using published_time field

&nbsp; &nbsp;
  #### 4.Data Visualisations
 **Tools** - *Power BI DashBoard*
    

&nbsp; &nbsp;
  #### 5. Report Building
  
   **Tools** - *Power BI Report-View*

- ## **Key Findings**

  - In the subject of subscriber 68%(7M) user joined in those courses whose provide all level(Begineer-Expert) specializations.
  - in free courses 5x students are subscribes than the paid courses
  - in price vs Subscriber point of view there are little bit positive(0.37) correlationship between them.so we can say when price increase there are little bit 
    also subscriber would be increased.
  - Also when the number of review increased threre are chances of increament of subscribers(Postive Relationship 0.47).
  -  In paid courses, subscribers leave more reviews than in unpaid courses.
  - october,november,february,march these are the months with most subscriber compare to other months.

<div align= "start">



- ## **Recommendations**

  - Udemy need to be added more courses of All level specializations for particlular subject.this can be beneficial because most of students are intrested in all 
     level specilizations courses.
  - Udemy can be also provide some low durations free courses to attract students for the subscriptions of that paid course. beacuse users most subscribed on free courses compare to paid.
  -    Udemy can highlight most reviews courses as top most this would be crucial for subscribers gaining.\
  -    If Courses uploaded on october novemeber and february,march  can be cruial to gain the more subscribers.
